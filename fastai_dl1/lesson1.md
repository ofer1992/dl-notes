# Lesson 1

Introduction to the course and it's ideas. Top-down learning approach. Using jupyter notebook, using
the fastai library. Code first!

Thanks to transfer learning, you *don't* need copious amount of data or training time/compute.

Where to get data:
- academic data sets
- kaggle competitions
- google images

Look at the data! Samples and labels.

Take it to your domain expertise (well, not that relevant for me)

What we saw in the lecture is the basic process of getting data, setting the model, and transfer
learning (training last layers, unfreezing and fine-tuning rest of model).

I was most impressed with how little time and data it required. For my homework I did interior
airport classification between five airports. With almost no fine tuning I reached 80% accuracy.
