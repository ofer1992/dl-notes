The first regulated, randomized, double-blind clinical trial was reported in the Journal of Wound Care in June 20 which evaluated the safety and efficacy of a bacteriophage cocktail to treat infected venous ulcers of the leg in human patients.[20] The FDA approved the study as a Phase I clinical trial. The study's results demonstrated the safety of therapeutic application of bacteriophages, but did not show efficacy. The authors explained that the use of certain chemicals that are part of standard wound care (e.g. lactoferrin or silver) may have interfered with bacteriophage viability.[20] Shortly after that, another controlled clinical trial in Western Europe (treatment of ear infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was reported in the journal Clinical Otolaryngology in August 9.[21] The study concludes that bacteriophage preparations were safe and effective for treatment of chronic ear infections in humans. Additionally, there have been numerous animal and other experimental clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of bacteriophages for various diseases, such as infected burns and wounds, and cystic fibrosis associated lung infections, among others.[2\n",

Without effective antibiotics the patient was subjected to phage therapy using a phage cocktail containing nine different phages that had been demonstrated to be effective against  A. baumannii.

    "In the chapter's opening, the author presents the weighing problem as a motivator for questions about the nature of information. By coincidence I happened to solve it about a week before (took me ~1.5 days), and I remember coming to the conclusion that the weighings/experiment should have rule out hypotheses equally. At the time I thought of it more like a game where the adversary will choose the outcome which makes it harder for you. Here we think about the hypotheses as probabilities, and so an experiment with equal \"division\" of results is equiprobable, and we saw in the last part that when the distribution is closer to uniform we maximize the entropy, the average content.\n",

    "The next example is the guessing game, or a lamer version called **sixty-three**. It demonstrates the connection between the Shannon information content and the size of a file the encodes the outcomes of a random experiment. In the game, you need to guess a number between 0 and 63. 6 bits suffice to represent a number in that range, so six questions (you can formulate the question in \"human-speak\", $x\\mod2^i\\geq 2^{i-1}$). If we assume the values of $x$ are equally likely, then the answers to the questions are independent and each answer has $\\log(1/0.5)=1\\text{ bit}$. From independence we get the total Shannon information gained is always six bits. Hmmm. Also, our questioning defines a way of encoding the random variable $x$ as a binary file, write down the answers. Question, what if the number of questions depends on the number?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is the game of **boring battleships**. A $8\\times8$ grid, one square is a submarine. We need to guess where it is. The question is: \"how many bits can one bit convey?\" The left \"bits\" is the unit of information and the right is a binary variable. If we get the first guess right, we get $h(x=\\text{hit})=\\log64=6\\text{ bits}$, and interestingly enough, 6 bits encode the location on the grid. Somehow one bit conveyed 6 bits! If on the other hand we miss we get $h(x=\\text{miss})=\\log\\frac{64}{63}=0.0227\\text{ bits}$. Let's imagine we miss the first 32 guesses, then\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\\log\\frac{64}{63}+\\dots+\\log\\frac{33}{32}\\\\\n",
    "=0.0227+\\dots+0.0430&=1.0\\text{ bits}\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "We ruled out 32 hypotheses, so just like the previous game we got 1 bit. Anyway, no matter at which guess we win the information we gain always sums up to 6 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we have **Wenglish**, a fake language with a 32768 long dictionary, the words are all 5 characters long and created by sampling 5 times independently from the **a...z** distribution introduced earlier. Let's imagine we are reading a Wenglish document consisting of words drawn at random. What is the information content of a word? since it's uniform we get $\\log32768=15\\text{ bits}$. So on average, 3 bits per character. \n",
    "\n",
    "What if we get the word a character at a time? It's a bit like 20 questions, we have 5 questions (what is the first/second... letter?) and we want to guess the word. Now, the letters are not uniformly distributed but if the word is $c_1c_2c_3c_4c_5$ then $c_i\\sim \\mathbf{a\\dots z}$ (techincally since the words are already sampled and constant, the actual distribution is a bit different and should be calculated straight from the sampled dictionary). Let's say $c_1=\\mathbf{z}$, what is the information content gained? $\\log(1/0.001)\\simeq10\\text{ bits}$! Contrast with $c_1=\\mathbf{a}$ where the information content is $\\log(1/0.0625)\\simeq4\\text{ bits}$. How can we make sense of that? since **z** is more rare, there are less words beginning with it, hence our \"search\" has narrowed down significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A question puzzles me; what if we get two **z**, isn't the information content 20 bits, more then 15 bits? isn't that some kind of contradiction? I'm not sure. It might be related to conditional information, or to the difference in the distributions caused by the sampling. In the text the author takes the 15 bit as a constraint and reasons that the rest of the letters must therefore have less information content.\n",

So at least 4 weights. Let's try solving constructivly. $w_1=1$, $w_2=2$? but then $w_2-w_1=1$ so I waste a combination. Let's choose $w_2=3$. Now I can cover 1-4. At this point I visualized the the next weight I choose has a segment around it with radius 4, covering all the numbers I could reach. So I chose $w_3=9$ to avoid overlap. Now we can cover 1-13 and with the same logic $w_4=27$ and we're done.\n",

    "_Comment:_ When I solved it in my head I made a mistake so it seemed at first I couldn't cover all 40 numbers. Also, I noticed that if you choose the next weight such that it's bigger then the sum of the previous, you lose all the combinations with it contributing negatively (if you don't use a heavier weight that is). How many combinations are then negative? 40, plus 1 where all the weights are missing, so we got exactly $81-(40+1)=40$ useful combinations for the 40 numbers. Nifty."

    "a) Is it possible to solve the 12 balls weighing problem using a sequence of three _fixed_ weighings?\n",
    "\n",
    "My initial intuition was no, since it is then \"simpler\" and therefore easier to come by. The 3 weighings can be characterized by thinking of the \"trip\" each ball takes. Each ball can start in either the left side, right side or out of the pans. Next it can change or stay. So we get $3^3=27$ possible courses for a ball. That's when I was puzzled, because it seems more than enough to identify a ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take the easier problem where we know whether the fake is heavier or lighter, can we solve it? well, if we move the balls between weighings in such a way that each ball takes a unique trip than we just need to keep track in each weighing where the pan was lifted/lowered and we should be able to identify the culprit.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the original problem? Let's imagine we have one ball that will stay on the left pan during the weighings and one ball that will stay on the right pan. Before, we could tell which one is fake because we knew the weight. Now, if the pans are so $L<R$ during the three weighings we have two possibilites: either the left is fake and its lighter, or the right is fake and it's heavier.\n",
    "\n",
    "So where's the catch? the problem is that the left ball's 'trip' is a mirror of the right ball's 'trip', ie, if we take the left ball's trip and switch every left pan postioning with a right pan positioning we'll get the right ball's trip. So without knowing the fake weight we can't differentiate between mirrored trips. Luckily though, we can find a set of 13 trips where neither is a mirror of another (I think there's some group theory justification). Well, 13 should be enough for 12 balls, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point I started coding, as seen below, giving each ball a number and a trip. I ran some tests, looks good! but then, a realization... Back when I originally solved the riddle, I separated the code to different parts, the balance and the algorithm, to make sure the algorithm can't cheat. But now I did everything quickly and just programmed the balance so it would be heavier or lighter where it had the fake coin. There is one problem though; It ignores if the balance has an even number of coins! Looking at the trips I chose, it was obvious some weighings were imbalanced. I could still flip the trips though, so could I fix the situation through flipping and choosing the right trips(I had 14 candidates so I had some flexibility)? Eventually I did, and it works. With 12 balls you can identify which one's the fake and whether it's heavier or lighter. With 13, you can still tell which one's fake but not neccessarily its weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part b) of the exercise is to prove the general case, that with $W$ weighings you can differentiate between $(3^W-3)/2$ balls. I assume you need to somehow prove that there is a set of different unmirrored trips that even up in each weighing, like I found heuristically."

The binary fractional encoding can result in the same encoding if the difference between two numbers is an integer and since $\\sum_il_i\\leq1$, $c_i\\neq c_j$ ($S_n=\\sum_i^{n-1}2^{l_i}<1$ so no worries).\n",

    "First of all, lets observe a couple of facts. Again, $[p_1,p_2,\\dots,p_n]$ is sorted in increasing order($n\\geq3$). Now, assuming $C$ is an optimal code for $X$, there are two symbols with equal and longest codeword length, $a$ and $b$. How so? An optimal code is always complete, otherwise there's a node with one child, and in that case we could cut the node and shorten the associated codewords with no cost. Also, if we look at the leaf for the longest codeword, it's parent must have another child and it must be a leaf as well, so that's our pair. Now, if $C$ is optimal, then $p(a)$ and $p(b)$ must be equal to $p_1$ and $p_2$, since otherwise we could switch $a$ or $b$ with $s_{p_1}/s_{p_2}$ and reduce the expected length, contradicting optimality (the only case where we can't reduce is when all the words have the same length, $p_1$ and $p_2$ will also have longest codewords).\n",
    "\n",
    "We're ready to prove by induction:\n",
    "- Base: $n=2$, there is one optimal code, $\\{0,1\\}$ and Huffman generates it.\n",
    "- Let's assume Huffman generates an optimal code for ensembles with $n$ symbols. Let $X$ be an ensemble with $n+1$ symbols, and let $C$ be an optimal code for it. Following the last paragraph, we can assume it has $p_1$ and $p_2$ as neighbouring leaves with longest codeword. If we replace them with a new symbol with the sum of probabilites, we get a new ensemble $X'$ of size $n$, and a new code $C'$, with a word shorter by 1 bit for the new symbol. Also, $$L(C,X)=L(C',X')+p_1+p_2$$From induction, $$L(C',X')\\geq L(C_{H(X')}, X')$$Now, what we did was exactly the first step of the Huffman algorithm for ensemble $X$, so $C_{H(X)}$ is $C_{H(X')}$ but instead of one codeword for the new symbol we have two codewords one bit longer for $p_1$ and $p_2$. Therefore, $$L(C_{H(X)},X)=L(C_{H(X')},X')+p_1+p_2\\leq L(C',X')+p_1+p_2=L(C,X)$$and we have shown Huffman is optimal.\n",
